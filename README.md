## About Me
Hi there! I'm AZ, an aspiring Information Systems professional with a passion for technology, problem-solving, and creativity. I believe that practice makes perfect, and I constantly strive to improve my skills through hands-on experience and continuous learning.

I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think outside the box, whether it's developing software, designing user-friendly interfaces, or optimizing systems for better performance. My goal is to contribute innovative solutions to real-world problems through technology.

Beyond coding, I have a keen interest in exploring new trends in tech, from cybersecurity to artificial intelligence. I’m always eager to collaborate, learn from others, and push my limits to grow as a developer.

This portfolio showcases my journey, projects, and the skills I’ve developed along the way. Feel free to explore and connect with me!
